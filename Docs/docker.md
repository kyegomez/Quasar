# Documentation for Docker-based Machine Learning Environment Configuration

## Introduction

### Overview
This documentation provides a detailed guide on setting up a Docker-based machine learning environment using NVIDIA CUDA and the `accelerate` library. It is designed to help users create a reproducible and scalable environment for machine learning projects.

### Purpose
The Docker configuration outlined here is intended to streamline the development process for machine learning practitioners, allowing them to leverage the power of NVIDIA GPUs and optimize their models using the `accelerate` library.

### Target Audience
This guide is intended for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and DevOps professionals who are familiar with Docker and are looking to set up a CUDA-enabled machine learning environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine
- Basic understanding of Docker commands and concepts
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support

### Installation Guide
1. Install Docker following the official [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. Ensure that the NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit are installed on your host machine.

## Docker Configuration

### Base Image
The Dockerfile starts with the NVIDIA CUDA 11.8.0 development environment for Ubuntu 22.04 as the base image. This image includes CUDA and the necessary tools to build CUDA applications.

### Working Directory
The `WORKDIR` instruction sets the working directory to `/workspace`. All subsequent commands will be executed in this directory.

### Dependencies Installation
The `RUN` command updates the package lists, installs Python 3, pip, git, and other necessary dependencies. It also installs the `accelerate` library and `bitsandbytes` for efficient training on NVIDIA GPUs.

### Environment Variables
The `ENV` instruction sets the `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` environment variable, which specifies the CUDA architectures that PyTorch will support.

### Python Environment
The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python dependencies required for the project. The Dockerfile copies this file into the container and installs the listed packages.

## Usage Examples

### Building the Docker Image
To build the Docker image, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run:
```sh
docker build -t my_ml_environment .
```

### Running the Container
To run the container with the built image:
```sh
docker run --gpus all -v $(pwd):/workspace my_ml_environment
```

### Using `accelerate` for Training
The `CMD` instruction in the Dockerfile specifies that the `accelerate launch train.py` command will be executed by default when the container starts.

## Best Practices

### Managing Data
Use Docker volumes to manage and persist data. The `volumes` instruction in the Docker Compose file mounts the current directory to the `/workspace` directory in the container.

### GPU Utilization
Ensure that the `--gpus all` flag is used when running the container to enable GPU support.

### Docker Compose
For ease of use, define the service in a `docker-compose.yml` file, allowing you to configure and start the container with a single command:
```sh
docker-compose up
```

## Troubleshooting

### GPU Access
If the container does not have access to the GPU, ensure that the NVIDIA Container Toolkit is installed and configured correctly.

### Dependency Conflicts
If there are conflicts with Python dependencies, review the `requirements.txt` file and adjust the package versions as necessary.
